<h2>About the company</h2>
<p>Thuswise Ltd is a company owned and operated by Dave Haynes.
Dave is a Chartered Engineer with 25 years experience in <a class="reference internal" href="#software">software</a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="#electronics">electronics</a> design. He contributes to <a class="reference internal" href="#open-source">open source</a> projects under the
handle <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tundish">tundish</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="electronics">
<h3>Electronics</h3>
<p>In the early days, Dave trained in Electronics design. Much of his work
supported engineering research programmes, involving end-to-end development of
prototype systems in areas as diverse as weld integrity analysis, high power
lasers, and assembling aircraft with robots.</p>
<p>Dave founded Thuswise Ltd in 1999, but continued to work for large engineering
firms. He produced a number of digital designs for FPGAs and ASICs,
including a safety-critical chip for a cruise missile. Over time, the software element of
Dave's work became more significant; first through the need to customise the
digital design workflow, and later through his design and simulation of entire
embedded control systems.</p>

<div class="section" id="software">
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>By 2005, Dave was writing software for corporate business systems and
undertaking architectural, design, and development work for government clients.
Three years with an Information Intelligence consultancy gave him a capability
in business process transformation, knowledge management and semantic
technologies. Then, as Thuswise Ltd, Dave secured a contract with a defence
supplier of mission planning software. This marked the transition to working
freelance under his own company name.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="open-source">
<h3>Open source</h3>
<p>These days, Dave likes to write software which solves your problems and slips
neatly into your pocket. He releases code to the public as <cite>tundish</cite>, most
often under a GPL licence. Every project is well-tested, documented and
properly packaged.</p>
<p>Dave's contributions range from minor patches to entire distributed web
systems. Check out the <a class="reference external" href="https://tundish.github.io/balladeer/pages/download.html">Download</a> page for more details.</p>
