<h2>Proclets</h2>
<p>Business workflow modelling is back in fashion. But the tools and techniques
available to practitioners have not really evolved much since the late 1990s.</p>
<p>A very promising approach is to use Workflow Nets, which are a type of Petri Net.
They were first suggested 20 years ago, but it fell to us to create the first
Python library to use them, called <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/proclets/">proclets</a>.</p>
<p>It's early days for this project, and it will continue to evolve.</p>

<div class="section" id="turberfield">
<h2>Turberfield</h2>
<p>Turberfield is a namespace for a number of packages we've released to support
the development of Interactive Fiction in Python.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/turberfield-dialogue/">Turberfield-dialogue</a> is an extension to <cite>reStructuredText</cite> which allows you
to write screenplays and computationally generated dialogue.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/turberfield-catchphrase/">Turberfield-catchphrase</a> comprises an innovative parser for interactive
text commands, and a rendering system for web publishing.</p>
<p>These libraries are experimental, and are under heavy development.</p>

<h2>Tallywallet</h2>
<p>Recent events have convinced us that understanding of the banking system
might be both better and wider than it is. Here is Thuswise Ltd's contribution
to that. What we believe is the first <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tallywallet-common">publicly available banking ledger</a>
to be written in Python.</p>
<p>It can perform currency trades, loan calculations, and economic simulations.</p>

<div class="section" id="maloja">
<h2>Maloja</h2>
<p>A piece of client work, this one.
A UK cloud provider requested a bespoke orchestration tool for use by its
public sector customer.</p>
<p>This was a very challenging but rewarding project. It's Open Source, and it's
called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/UKCloud/maloja">Maloja</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cloudhands">
<h2>Cloudhands</h2>
<p>We're delighted that a project we undertook for a UK government agency is to
be released under an open source licence. It's a web portal front end to a
VMware community cloud. It uses all the latest asynchronous features of
Python 3 to implement a distributed architecture which should scale properly
as this project develops.</p>
<p>We wish it well. You can find the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cedadev/cloudhands-web">cloudhands repositories here</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="hwit">
<h2>HWIT</h2>
<p>Thuswise created a product called <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hwit-examples">Here's What I Think</a>, an
application which is released under a Free software licence.
It's a sort of offline Survey Monkey. Great for data gathering, cleaning,
processing, migration and transformation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cybele">
<h2>Cybele</h2>
<p>This project shows what we can deliver under very short timescales. It's
a log aggregator for a Windows environment. It was written, tested, documented,
and packaged in three working days. The client is a systems administration and
web operations consultancy. The code for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tundish/cybele">Cybele is on Github</a>.</p>

<h2>Schema migration for <cite>open-hea</cite></h2>
<p>We met these people at the UK Python conference in 2012. They were supporting
survey and charity work in developing countries. Their data collection
application required a test suite and some architectural decoupling from their
live MySQL database.</p>
<p>Thuswise redefined their schema using <cite>SQLAlchemy</cite>. This allowed unit tests to
be created within an in-memory <cite>sqlite</cite> database, whilst targeting MySQL in
production. This is an approach we've found useful several times since.</p>
<p>We even wrote a tool to check that the SQLAlchemy-generated schema was exactly
the same as the one they had designed by hand. You can find our <a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/open-hea/source/browse/#hg%2Fsrc%2Fopenhea%2Ftests">contributions
to open-hea</a> on Google code.</p>
