        <p>We supply <a class="reference internal" href="#software-development">software development</a> and occasional <a class="reference internal" href="#electronic-design-services">electronic design services</a>.</p>
<p>We have products in the niche areas of <a class="reference internal" href="#workflow-modelling">workflow modelling</a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="#cloud-tooling">cloud tooling</a>  which we can make available to you on a negotiated
basis.</p>
<div class="section" id="software-development">
<h2>Software development</h2>
<p>Thuswise has been programming with Python for many years. This excellent
language allows deployment across platforms and has low cost of maintenance.
We work with a 'full stack' of technologies.</p>
<p>We've made GUIs in <cite>PyQt4</cite> and <cite>wxWidgets</cite>. Large web applications in <cite>Pyramid</cite>
and small ones in <cite>bottle</cite>. Database schema design and access with
<cite>SQLAlchemy</cite>. Data processing pipelines with <cite>luigi</cite>.</p>
<p>Asynchronous agent-based programming with <cite>asyncio</cite>. Remote invocation tooling
with <cite>execnet</cite>. Web API interfacing via <cite>aiohttp</cite>.</p>
<p>We've used <cite>pyglet</cite> OpenGL bindings for 3D visualisation, and created wrappers
to 3rd-party libraries with <cite>pybindgen</cite>.</p>
<p>We have history in application development in C++.
This includes use of STL and Boost libraries.
We have worked with <cite>boost::asio</cite> and can help you negotiate the learning
curve associated with that and other technologies.</p>
<p>We can also code in C. We typically create small object-oriented (PIMPL)
libraries which can be loaded as shared objects using Python's <cite>ctypes</cite> module.</p>
<p>Our strong instinct is for iterative, agile development using open source
toolchains. Our projects are fully documented (usually with <cite>Sphinx</cite>) and
professionally packaged for deployment into production.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="workflow-modelling">
<h2>Workflow Modelling</h2>
<p>In seeking to model business processes, or more abstract social simulations,
we've educated ourselves in the use of Workflow Nets (a type of Petri Net).</p>
<p>These Workflows can be implemented as code objects called <cite>Proclets</cite>.
We publish and maintain the only <cite>proclets</cite> library to be written in Python.</p>
<p>We are keen to work with consultants and early adopters to deploy Proclets wherever
they are appropriate. <a class="reference external" href="https://tundish.github.io/balladeer/pages/contact.html">Contact</a> Thuswise to discover how it could start working for
your organisation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cloud-tooling">
<h2>Cloud tooling</h2>
<p>Thuswise has experienced <cite>Openstack</cite> from the perspective of a public cloud
provider. We understand the challenges associated with such a deployment.
We have created tooling to monitor data quality in the Nova database, which we
can supply with guidance if you're running such an installation.</p>
<p>More recently, we've been coding against the <cite>VMware vCloud Director</cite> API to
create a web portal for a government client's internal cloud. This project is
open source and might provide a springboard for your own VMware front end.</p>
<p>In addition, we're well used to creating Python scripts for devops use. We've
worked with each of <cite>Chef</cite>, <cite>Puppet</cite>, <cite>Ansible</cite> and <cite>Fabric</cite> over the last
year or two. We are pleased to have made some modest code contributions to
the <cite>execnet</cite> library. Our favourite tool in this space now however is <cite>mitogen</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="electronic-design-services">
<h2>Electronic design services</h2>
<p>Do you have a large scale chip design or an embedded system to deliver?
Thuswise can take part at various stages in your design flow. Here's where we
think we can add particular value:</p>
<div class="section" id="system-architecture">
<h3>System architecture</h3>
<p>We can help you partition your design by producing for you a behavioural
simulation of your proposed system. This cross-platform program forms an
executable definition. It enables understanding in multi-disciplinary teams and
helps inform key design decisions.</p>
<p>Once partitioned, we can formalise your design in Unified Modelling Language
(UML) or by producing Interface Control Documents (ICDs).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design-validation">
<h3>Design validation</h3>
<p>We can create a simulation in Python or behavioural VHDL to generate test
vectors and patterns. This can give you independent validation of your design
decisions. We can also undertake code reviews.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="prototyping">
<h3>Prototyping</h3>
<p>We have experience in rapid prototyping of systems using development and
evaluation boards. We have targeted Actel, Altera and Xilinx FPGAs.</p>
