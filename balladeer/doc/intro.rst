Introduction
============

Thanks for choosing Balladeer for your next writing project.
You steer the vessel. I was me who picked the crew.

Python, an elegant, flexible, popular programming language.
SpeechMark a simple, expressive markup system.
TOML a standardized, well-specified data format.
HTML5 the ubiquitous syntax for portable, structured electronic documents.
CSS3 powerful styling rules for layouts, themes and animation.

The challenge in the fitting out of Balladeer was to stop this bunch from fighting.

I had to figure out the fundamental action of each of these technologies.
Then I had to put them all together without introducing friction.
In the same way a gearbox couples an engine to a loaded axle,
or a waveguide finds the match between an amplifier and an antenna.

If you're reading this any time after June 2023, you'll be happy to learn
that I was successful.

You can now...

Parser-driven interactive fiction
Choice-based game books
Multimedia web art
Poetry and Screenplay

Balladeer tries to be simple. Don't think less of it for that. Simplicity is its mission.
This is the documentation for the Balladeer API.
