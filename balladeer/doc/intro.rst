Introduction
============

Thanks for choosing Balladeer for your next writing project!

Your job is to steer the vessel. All I did was pick the crew.
And here they are:

Python_
    A popular, elegant, flexible programming language.
SpeechMark_
    A simple, expressive dialogue markup system.
TOML_
    A structured data format. Highly specified, and widely adopted.
HTML5_
    The ultimate syntax for semantic, portable, electronic documents.
CSS3_
    Powerful styling rules for layouts, themes and animation.

Each of them is a force of nature.
The challenge I had was to stop this bunch from fighting.

It took half a gallon of rum and three ounces of butter.
They are all working together now; hardly any friction at all.

We completed our sea trials in June 2023. And now we are ready for action.

    Balladeer is a great option for every kind of mission.

    * Parser-driven interactive fiction
    * Choice-based game books
    * Multimedia web art
    * Poetry
    * Screenplay


    You'll find Balladeer simple to handle. And she'll take you anywhere you want to go.
