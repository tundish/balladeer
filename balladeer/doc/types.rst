Basic types
===========

Python is a very flexible language. It supports object
oriented design. At the same time its standard data
types are extremely powerful and often sufficient by
themselves.

Balladeer tries to minimize the number of classes you
need to learn. It's less than a dozen in total.

There are a couple which are fundamental to the Balladeer
philosophy. We will see them in use soon. So here's some
detail on them before we proceed further.

States
~~~~~~

.. autoclass:: balladeer.lite.types.State
   :members:
   :member-order: bysource

.. literalinclude:: ../lite/types.py
   :pyobject: Detail

Grouping

.. autoclass:: balladeer.lite.types.Grouping
   :members:
   :member-order: bysource
