If you forget to create an Entity for the knife which kills Caesar, what does it matter?
During the scene of the murder, Brutus always comes up with one anyway
whether it is mentioned in the script or not.
That knife exists in the mind of the reader. It has to be, otherwise no dead Emperor.

The role of most of our literature is, it seems, to destroy the world.

-- Jean Paul Gustave Ricouer

I would say, to destroy history.
We inhabit the present, and always have done. Nevertheless our options are shaped by the wreckage of the past.

This is because not only does literature fix speech, when that speech is performed in the mind of the reader,
it comes without references.

Interactive fiction relies on objects a lot. It says,
"Here is a knife that would serve to kill Caesar. And who knows,
maybe we'll meet him later. What would you like to do with it?"
